## ABSTRACT

Event tickets “are” nowadays unique identifiers that are printed on paper as barcodes,
and scanned at the entrance gate. While this system is convenient and secure for the
event organizer, it bears risks and inconveniences for the ticket owner and event
manager. We developed a prototype system in whichevent tickets are managed as assets
on a blockchain. The system prevents ticket theft as well as fraud such as selling invalid
tickets, or selling multiplecopies of a ticket, by leveraging the consistency features of
the blockchain.We develop a blockchain-based event ticket management system that
utilizes smart contracts to enforce and authorize the executions of transactions. The
transactions of buying and using event tickets are verified by the blockchain, which
also ensures the authenticity and security of the tickets. The experimental results show
that the proposed system is very efficient and requires only a nominal cost. Developing
a secure central system that not only accelerates the process of event ticket
management but also makes it efficient will be effective. Users can create an event by
entering the event name, date, price of each ticket, and total ticket count. They can
transfer their tickets from their account to another account by entering the account
details and the total amount of tickets to transfer. This can be done only if the user
holds the ticket, at the same time they can view and manageall the events. Also, they
can buy the tickets by entering the count using ethers(metamask wallet). As the
blockchain technologies can ensure information integrity, ticket buyers can use the data
stored in the blockchainnetwork to ensure the authenticity of the purchased tickets and
to resolve related disputes.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
